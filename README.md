<b>Site: </b> [AnimeTime](https://anime-time-mu.vercel.app)

Uses the JIKAN API (MyAnimeList Scraper) and AnimeSchedule.net API for seasonal anime data 

<u>Features</u>:
- Gets all seasonal anime for 4 seasons: TV (current and continuing anime), movie, OVA, ONA, specials.
  - Option to filter by various attributes
- Create an account to save and keep track of shows you're interested in

<u>Known Bugs</u>:
- Current episode number not displayed
- Potential issues with exact times the shows air (not sure if this is an issue with the API or not)
- Long running continuing anime (like One Piece) don't show up due to how the Jikan API works

<u>Warning:</u> This site might break if there are API changes.
